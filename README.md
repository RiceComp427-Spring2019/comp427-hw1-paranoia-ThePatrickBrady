## Problem 1
- Scenario: Stadium
- Assumptions:
  - I am assuming that the stadium is a normal stadium with only one field in it with many
    stands surrounding the field in the typical bowl shape and that the stadium is not 
    directly touching any other buildings but is free-standing.

- Assets:
  - Players - The football players from both teams, home and away. They are probably the most important asset that you need to protect because if anything happens to them it will be in the headlines and cause major loss in revenue.
  - The stadium itself - The physical structure of the stadium. This is a bit vague, but I'm thinking about this in the context of damage to the stadium structure.
  - Fans - all the people from both sides who came to watch. While they are not as in the spotlight as the players, they still need to be protected and their safty is a priority.
  - Vendors at Stadium - people working at food/concession stands in the stadium as their job.
- Threats:
  - stealing from vendors - this is very much like ordinary theft. 
  - stealing from fans
  - physical harm to players from fans - this could be in the form of fans going onto the field to attack them close range or using various forms of projectiles including weapons like guns.
  - bombs or explosives - self explanatory. a device to cause large amounts of damage to the structure or to injure people
  - fan vs fan violence - Since I have an obligation to protect fans, fans fighting each other in close range using hand-to-hand violence or with the use of weapons.
- Countermeasures:
  - checking bags at entrance - This is an essential countermeasure. It prevents most weapons or explosive devices from entering the stadium. The cost is that you have to have many security workers staff these checked areas and fans do not usually enjoy having their bags checked, but the consequences of weapons such as guns or explosives entering the stadium is too high and justifies this measure.
  - security guards stationed around the stadium, particularly at enterances and stairwells. They will be able to respond to any reported theft and be close at hand to stop any fights. Additionally, a visible security presence is likely to act as a preventative measure for any unruly behavior.
  
  - before the game, do a quick sweep of the stadium to make sure it is empty/no threats. Like we mentioned in class, a good way to sneak into somewhere is just to stay
  - limit number of fans to the number of seats
  - designate home and away sections to reduce fan violence
  - police presence in parking lot to prevent fan vs fan violence
  - have a barrier with the parking lot entry so not just anyone can drive in
  - have phones around stadium to contact authorities
  - have a few security personel around the entrance and exit that the football players use to get the bus to/from the stadium
  - guards outside VIP areas

## Problem 2
- Scenario: Grading
- Assumptions:
  - I am assuming that this is a computer science class with an online submission of written work and/ or code.
  - I am assuming that there are TAs to assist in the grading
- Assets:
  - Student privacy
  - Student's accurate grades - consistency and giving credit for OWN work
  - explanatory_paragraph ...
- Threats:
  - students not submitting their own work
  - students (or any outsider) seeing other students grades
  - students submitting work that is not their own
  - electronic failure of the online grade submitting system
  - typing the grades in wrong
  - TAs grading unfairly due to bias
  - explanatory_paragraph ...
- Countermeasures:
  - keeping a paper copy of any paper submissions
  - posting the grades online for students to verify
  - having one person do consistency checking on TAs grading
  - make a policy that TAs do not grade significant others
  - use a secure online site with authentication
  - periodically backing up the gradebook on a secure server or computer

## Problem 3
- Scenario: You are overseeing North Servery at Rice University
- Assumptions:
  - explain_your_assumptions
- Assets:
  - Food quality/ safety
  - Student Safety
  - I don't know how to articulate this, but only allowing authorized students in.
