## Problem 1
- Scenario: Stadium
- Assumptions:
  - I am assuming that the stadium is a normal stadium with only one field in it with many
    stands surrounding the field in the typical bowl shape and that the stadium is not 
    directly touching any other buildings but is free-standing.

- Assets:
  - Players - The football players from both teams, home and away. They are probably the most important asset that you need to protect because if anything happens to them it will be in the headlines and cause major loss in revenue.
  - The stadium itself - The physical structure of the stadium. This is a bit vague, but I'm thinking about this in the context of damage to the stadium structure.
  - Fans - all the people from both sides who came to watch. While they are not as in the spotlight as the players, they still need to be protected and their safety is a priority.
  - Vendors at Stadium - people working at food/concession stands in the stadium as their job.
- Threats:
  - stealing from vendors - this is very much like ordinary theft from stores. 
  - stealing from fans - again, very much like ordinary theft from people on the street.
  - physical harm to players from fans - this could be in the form of fans going onto the field to attack them close range or using various forms of projectiles including weapons like guns.
  - bombs or explosives - self explanatory. a device to cause large amounts of damage to the structure or to injure people
  - fan vs fan violence - Since I have an obligation to protect fans, fans fighting each other in close range using hand-to-hand violence or with the use of weapons.
- Countermeasures:
  - checking bags at entrance - This is an essential countermeasure. It prevents most weapons or explosive devices from entering the stadium. The cost is that you have to have many security workers staff these checked areas and fans do not usually enjoy having their bags checked, but the consequences of weapons such as guns or explosives entering the stadium is too high and justifies this measure.
  - security guards stationed around the stadium, particularly at entrances and stairwells. They will be able to respond to any reported theft and be close at hand to stop any fights. Additionally, a visible security presence is likely to act as a preventative measure for any unruly behavior. They are worth the cost of paying for their time.
  
  - before the game, do a quick sweep of the stadium to make sure it is empty/no threats. Like we mentioned in class, a good way to sneak into somewhere is just to stay until the area's perimeter is secured, and then you are past security. Doing an exhaustive sweep is probably too expensive and time intensive so a few security guards doing the weep is probably adequate.
  - limit number of fans to the number of seats. If you allow too many people in, it is a fire hazard to have too many people than the exits can accommodate in a reasonable time. The 'cost' of this is you might be missing out on selling tickets to people who want to go, but it is not logical to overbook the stadium.
  - police presence in parking lot to prevent fan vs fan violence. After the game especially if people were drinking violence may happen outside where there is less perceived police presence so having a few officers driving around the parking lot might help ensure that people stay civil especially after important games. Included in this might be officers to direct traffic so people don't get impatient and make unsafe traffic maneuvers. You would only need to hire these people for after the game so the cost would probably be lower than having the guards there all game.
  - have phones around stadium to contact authorities. Im not sure if this is actually in stadiums, but having anyone be able to pick up the phone and contact security at the stadium instantly would be a good safety precaution that has un upfront cost but low ongoing cost.
  - have a few security personnel around the entrance and exit that the football players use to get the bus to/from the stadium. The players need a bit more security than the average fan, so making sure they have a safe entrance and exit is important. You can probably reuse the guards from the general stadium area for minimal additional cost before and after the game.
  - security cameras. Like the phones, expensive to install but low upkeep and provides a record of people's movement that can be used to help solve security issues live or after the fact in cases like theft. The cameras are definitely worth the cost since they enable you to hire less guards since you are able to monitor more areas from one place.


## Problem 2
- Scenario: Grading
- Assumptions:
  - I am assuming that this is a computer science class with an online submission of written work and/ or code.
  - I am assuming that there are TAs to assist in the grading
- Assets:
  - Student privacy. Protecting privacy is a right under FERPA and general moral decency. I would need to put reasonable effort towards protecting other students from seeing the grades of students in the class or letting that information get out to 3rd parties.
  - Student's accurate grades - consistency and giving credit for OWN work. Student's work needs to be protected as best as possible from people who may be trying to access submitted work. Should not be modified by outside sources.
  - Answer keys - the answers to the homework needs to be protected and hidden from students until after the assignment is due.
- Threats:
  - students not submitting their own work. This can be a threat to the integrity of the class.
  - students (or any outsider) seeing other students’ grades.
  - electronic failure of the online grade submitting system. Depending on the system used, this may or may not be a problem. I will discuss this more in the countermeasures section.
  - TAs who are biased or actively attempting to sabotage grades of the student in the class.

- Countermeasures:
  - keeping a paper copy of any paper submissions. This can be used as a backup in case an online copy is lost or destroyed in an attack. It is most likely to be used in cases of grade disputes. The cost for keeping paper copies around are low since they just take up some space in a locked cabinet for instance.
  - posting the grades online for students to verify. Allowing students to keep track of their grades throughout the class will allow them to continuously check their grades for any inconsistencies in the way that grades were entered. This prevents the possibility of an instructor’s computer being used to enter false grades if it is taken over or used in any way. The cost to this is usually low, because most grading software has this capability built in to allow students to view released grades.
  - having one more trusted person like the instructor do consistency checking on TAs grading. This ensures that no TA can go rogue without being detected. It is more work on behalf of the instructor, but in a class this big, the benefits of keeping grading uniform will reduce the amount of work of regrades.
  - grading itself be done not in a public area. In public spaces, it is easy to have your screen be read over your shoulder violating the privacy of student records if you have the gradebook just open. The cost of this is convenience, that you are restricting the places where you can grade a little bit. I think it is work it to keep in mind that if you have a gradebook open your back should be to a wall.
  - use a secure online site with authentication if you are entering them online. For example, canvas is secure (to my knowledge) so it is a safe place to upload grades. I don’t know the cost of having canvas, but the pain of entering the grades there is worth the database functionality that canvas provides.
  - periodically backing up the gradebook on a secure server or computer. Although it would take up storage and take some time to do, it would be a good idea to back up the data occasionally onto a secure server in case canvas has a failure and loses data. The cost is not too large and the probability that a failure happens is so low that I would not call this countermeasure a priority.




## Problem 3
- Scenario: You are overseeing North Servery at Rice University
- Assumptions:
  - I am assuming that I am overseeing the servery during the school year
- Assets:
  - Food quality/ safety. The servery provides a large amount of food to the students daily. Following food safety standards to keep students safe is very important. 
  - Computer
  - Student Safety

- Threats:

- Countermeasures:
  - card readers to charge students with a staff member to serve be stationed at each card reader, which is at each enterance. The staff who work at the card readers also should challenge students who they do not think swiped in who are not on a meal plan. This ensures that the servery resources are only available to those who are paying for them. The cost is to have to pay someone to be usually very bored sitting at a card reader for extended period of time during every meal.
  - Disalow students to enter kitchen except by permission - This is a low cost and relatively standard procedure. The cost is that if someone needs something from the kitchen a staff member has to get it for them and a few minutes productivity is wasted, but food regulation standards are upheld by keeping untrained people out of the kitchen.
